Livestock Value Chain Strategy for the Farmers’ Field School (FFS) Programme in Nigeria
1. Executive Summary
This strategy document outlines a comprehensive approach to integrating a livestock value chain perspective into the Farmers’ Field School (FFS) program in Nigeria. The goal is to transform subsistence-oriented livestock production into ICT- innovative, knowledge driven, market-oriented, climate-resilient, inclusive, and profitable enterprises, while strengthening food security, nutrition, and rural livelihoods. The strategy covers inputs, production, aggregation, processing, marketing, and support services, and is tailored to Nigeria’s diverse agro-ecological zones. Also to align the FFS model into the Livestock Productivity and Resilient Support (L-PRES) project and National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) for the holistic livestock value chain enterprise and industry development.
2. Rationale and Context
Nigeria’s livestock sector (poultry, small ruminants, cattle, pigs, aquaculture-linked livestock systems, and emerging value chains such as rabbits and snails) contributes significantly to Gross domestic product (GDP), employment, and nutrition, yet faces challenges including:
•	Low productivity and high mortality rates
•	Weak input and service delivery systems
•	Poor husbandry and biosecurity practices
•	Limited access to finance and markets
•	High post-production losses and food safety risks
•	Climate and disease shocks
The FFS model, built on experiential learning and collective action, provides a strong platform to address these constraints across the entire value chain, rather than focusing only on on-farm production.
3. Overall Goal and Strategic Objectives
3.1 Goal
To strengthen Nigeria’s livestock value chains through a market-driven Farmers’ Field School approach that improves productivity, profitability, resilience, and inclusivity for smallholder producers. The existing FFS model had been all comers affair but a deliberate and decisive approach towards the development of the livestock industry is very imperative incorporating both the smallholders and the investors as well as other value chain actors.
3.2 Strategic Objectives
1.	ICT innovative-approach and knowledge driven livestock extension delivery.
2.	Improve livestock productivity and survival through Good Animal Husbandry Practices (GAHP)
3.	Strengthen producer capacity to meet market, quality, and food safety standards
4.	Enhance value addition, aggregation, and collective marketing
5.	Improve access to inputs, services, finance, and insurance
6.	Promote climate-smart, gender-responsive, and youth-inclusive livestock systems
7.	Strengthen linkages between farmers, processors, traders, and regulators
4. Livestock Value Chain Framework within FFS
The FFS program will structure learning and action around seven interconnected value chain nodes:
1.	Research –extension farmers’ linkage system improvement.
2.	Input Supply Systems
3.	Production and Husbandry
4.	Animal Health and Biosecurity
5.	Aggregation, Processing, and Value Addition
6.	Marketing and Market Systems
7.	Enabling Environment and Support Services
Each node is translated into FFS learning modules, field experiments, and collective business actions.
5. Detailed Strategic Pillars
pillars	Key Issues	FFS Strategies	Outputs
1.	Input Supply and Service Systems	•	Poor quality feed, drugs, and breeding stock
•	Limited access to veterinary and extension services
•	Standards and quality control measures.
	Organic agriculture program.
Input quality identification and testing sessions (feeds, vaccines, drugs)
Demonstration of local feed formulation using crop residues and agro-industrial by-products.
Community-based input aggregation and bulk purchasing through FFS groups
Engagement of private veterinarians, agro-dealers, and para-vets as FFS resource persons	Reduced cost of production by 20%
Improved input quality assurance by 10%

2.Production and Good Animal Husbandry Practices (GAHP)	•	Species-specific husbandry (poultry, goats, sheep, cattle, pigs)
•	Housing, feeding, watering, breeding, and welfare	Season-long learning cycles aligned with animal growth stages
Comparative trials (improved vs traditional practices)
Farmer-led data collection on growth rates, feed conversion, and mortality	Increased productivity by 20% and reduced mortality by 10%
Standardized husbandry practices at community level by 30%
3.Animal Health, Biosecurity, and One Health	•	Endemic diseases (ND, ASF, PPR, CBPP)
•	Poor biosecurity and zoonotic risks
	Participatory disease surveillance and reporting
Biosecurity mapping of farms and communities
Vaccination calendars integrated into FFS schedules
Training on antimicrobial stewardship and withdrawal periods
Integration of One Health principles (human–animal–environment interface)	•	Reduced disease incidence by 20%
•	Improved public health and food safety outcomes by 20%

4.Aggregation, Processing, and Value Addition	•	Distress sales and low farm-gate prices
•	Minimal value addition
	Collective aggregation models (live animals, eggs, milk)
Introduction to basic processing: slaughter hygiene, milk handling, egg grading
Women- and youth-led micro-processing units (smoking, drying, packaging)
Cost–benefit analysis of value addition options	•	Increased producer margins by 30%
•	Reduced post-production losses by 20%

5.Marketing, Business Skills, and Market Linkages	•	Weak market information and bargaining power
•	Organized and online marketing channels
	Livestock market mapping and price discovery exercises
Training on grading, standards, and buyer requirements
Collective marketing and contract negotiation simulations
Digital tools for market information and record keeping	•	Improved market access and price realization by 20%
•	Transition from subsistence to commercial orientation by 10%
6.Enabling Environment, Finance, and Institutional Linkages	•	Limited access to finance, insurance, and supportive policies
	Financial literacy and enterprise budgeting modules
Linkage with microfinance banks, cooperatives, and development finance institutions
Introduction to livestock insurance and risk management tools
Engagement with local governments and regulators	•	Increased investment in livestock enterprises by 20%
•	Stronger institutional support systems by 10%

6. Cross-Cutting Themes
6.1 Gender and Social Inclusion
•	Targeted women-only and youth FFS groups
•	Promotion of enterprises with low entry barriers
•	Leadership and entrepreneurship training
6.2 Climate-Smart Livestock Practices
•	Heat stress management and water efficiency
•	Improved pasture, fodder, hay, and silage systems
•	Manure management and biogas opportunities
6.3 Nutrition and Food Safety
•	Promotion of animal-source foods for household nutrition
•	Hygiene, slaughter, and milk safety practices
7. Implementation Arrangements
•	Lead Institutions: FMLD and State Ministries of Agriculture
•	Technical Partners: Research institutes, universities, NGOs
•	Delivery Agents: Extension officers trained as FFS facilitators
•	Private Sector: Input suppliers, processors, off-takers
FFS cycles will run for 9–12 months, aligned with livestock production cycles.
8. Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL)
Key Indicators
•	Productivity (mortality, growth rates, output per animal)
•	Income and profitability
•	Adoption of GAHP and biosecurity practices
•	Market participation rates
Participatory M&E tools will be embedded within FFS sessions.
9. Scaling and Sustainability Strategy
•	Graduation of FFS groups into cooperatives or agribusiness clusters
•	Training of Community-Based Facilitators (CBFs)
•	Integration into state livestock development plans
•	Blended finance and PPP models
10. Conclusion: Integrating a livestock value chain strategy into Nigeria’s FFS program offers a powerful pathway to transform smallholder livestock systems into resilient, market-linked, and inclusive value chains. By addressing constraints from inputs to markets, the FFS model becomes not just a learning platform, but a driver of rural economic transformation.
