# Session State & Cold-Start Handoff — 2026-06-15/16

> **Purpose:** a running record of this session so that if it closes (token/context loss), the next session can **start cold and resume without missing anything**. Read this top-to-bottom first. It points to the canonical trackers (sprint-status, pending-operator-actions, runbooks) rather than duplicating them. **Keep §0 + §4 current as work proceeds.**

---

## 0. YOU ARE HERE (TL;DR)

- **`main` @ `195fc5b`, origin in sync (0/0), CI green, 9-58 deployed to prod.** Working tree clean except the corrupted form (§4.1) + the redundant xlsx backups.
- **Immediate next:** the master form is **REBUILT + verified + committed** (clean Excel-valid `oslsr_master_v3.xlsx`, 66 q, email question + N3 label, converter test 10/10). **Only the operator RE-PIN to prod remains** (§4.1) — the last thing blocking the 9-58 email features for field registrants.
- **Then:** convene **Bob (SM)** + **John (PM)** to align the planning artifacts (epics/PRD/architecture/UX-spec/project-context) and author the two design initiatives (§6) as properly-sequenced stories, so no nuance is lost.
- **Not gating the field launch:** 9-59, the analytics redesign, and the design-system refresh are all post-launch.

## 2. KEY EVENTS / DECISIONS (narrative, so a cold start has the "why")

1. **9-55 push flake fixed** — pre-push web suite starved its vitest worker pool; added `VITEST_MAX_THREADS=2` cap. Pitfall #37 root cause #1b.
2. **Export-CSV investigation** → discovered the registry data shape (§5). Produced one-off prod CSVs (§7) + the re-engagement campaign runbook.
3. **9-58 authored → dev → adversarial code review** (4 parallel reviewers; 1 High / 5 Med / 6 Low — ALL fixed). Load-bearing decision: **server reference code is CANONICAL; the client-minted code is a display-only provisional reconciled from the sync result** (closed the merge-divergence dead-code M1 + the attacker-chosen-code vector M2; supersedes the Round-2 "verbatim client code"). H2 per-email magic-link throttle added. **Email-FIRST delivery made explicit** (phone fallback wired, pending Termii SMS).
3. **9-58 push went CI-RED** — web `vite build` failed because `@oslsr/utils` barrel re-exports server-only `crypto.ts` (`node:crypto`) and 9-58's web code imported `generateReferenceCode` from the barrel. **Prod never impacted** (deploy is gated behind the build). Forward-fixed with a deep import + a `turbo run build` step in the pre-push gate. **The local gate is now a strict superset of CI: lint + tsc + build + test.**
4. **Follow-up pass:** 9-30/9-28 closed, 9-18 reconciled, 9-59 authored (§3).
5. **Reference-code backfill RUN ON PROD:** `--dry-run` (139) → `--apply --confirm-…` (assigned=139, skipped=0, failed=0) → verified (0 remaining). All existing respondents now have `OSL-2026-XXXXXX` codes. Audit rows written.
6. **Corrupted master form discovered** (§4.1).
7. **Two design discussions opened** (§6): analytics redesign + design-system refresh.

## 3. STORY STATUS CHANGES THIS SESSION (see sprint-status.yaml for the source of truth)

- **9-55** → done · **9-56** → done · **9-57** → done · **9-58** → done · **9-30** → done · **9-28** → done
- **9-18** → stays **review** — reconciled (Task 5.5 backfill RUN on prod 2026-06-11, 5.8 moot). **Sole remaining gate: AC#E9** (Step-4 stall <30% over 7 days via the 9-19 dashboard) — **window closes 2026-06-18**, then flip → done if met.
- **9-59** unified-registry-export → **ready-for-dev** (NEW; post-launch; includes Task 6 = `@oslsr/utils` barrel-split hygiene).

## 4. OPEN / REMAINING — THE RESUME CHECKLIST

### 4.1 ✅ Master form REBUILT (2026-06-16) — only the operator re-pin remains
**DONE:** the corrupted 15kb fixture was replaced with a clean Excel-valid rebuild (`oslsr_master_v3.xlsx`, 18896 bytes, 66 q, version `2026061501`, email question after `phone_number` with the N3 purpose label, guardian group preserved; converter test 10/10 green; committed). **REMAINING (operator):** upload `oslsr_master_v3.xlsx` to prod + **re-pin** `wizard.public_form_id` per `docs/runbooks/email-question-repin-9-58.md` (can ride the 9-55 re-pin cycle). Until re-pinned, the email auto-confirm + email-search stay dark for field registrants. _(The redundant `oslsr_master_v3_email.xlsx` working copy can be deleted.)_

<details><summary>Original problem (for reference)</summary>
- `test-fixtures/oslsr_master_v3.xlsx` is **15kb, won't open in Excel** (a library write — SheetJS/exceljs — stripped Excel compatibility; stray empty `xl/worksheets/` entry is the tell). It **does** parse in the app (66 questions, has the `email` question + guardian group, version `2026061501`) — so it's *app-valid but Excel-invalid*.
- Valid backups (~50–60kb, Excel-openable): `oslsr_master_v3.pre-email.bak.xlsx` (65 q, has guardian, **no email**, v`2026012601`) and `oslsr_master_v3_backup.xlsx` (56 q, original, no guardian). **Use `.pre-email.bak.xlsx` as the rebuild base.**
- **FIX:** open `oslsr_master_v3.pre-email.bak.xlsx` in Excel → in the `survey` sheet add a row after `phone_number` in `grp_identity`: `type=text`, `name=email`, `required`=blank, `label=`**`Email address (optional) — we'll send your registration confirmation and reference number here`** (this is the deferred **N3 purpose label**) → bump `settings.version` to `2026061501` → Save As `oslsr_master_v3.xlsx` (overwrite the 15kb file). Then **ask Claude to run the converter test** to confirm it parses (66 q, email present), **replace the repo fixture + commit**, then **re-migrate/upload/re-pin** to prod.

</details>

### 4.2 Operator actions (not code)
- **9-18 AC#E9 check on 2026-06-18** → flip 9-18 → done if Step-4 stall <30% (9-19 dashboard). *(`/schedule` candidate — offered, not yet set.)*
- **Re-engagement blasts** — gated on **Resend Pro** + **Termii sender-ID** (multi-day lead). Reference codes now backfilled ✅, so blast emails can carry the application number. Playbook: `docs/runbooks/re-engagement-campaign-launch.md`. Must-fix before firing: the Cohort-B `data_lost` dedup exclusion (flagged on 9-27).
- **PII CSVs on the operator Desktop** (§7) — delete after outreach.

### 4.3 Future stories / dev (post-launch, not gating)
- **9-59** unified-registry-export (the durable export fix + barrel-split Task 6) — ready-for-dev.
- **Analytics redesign epic** + **Design-system refresh epic** (§6) — to be authored by SM/PM.

### 4.4 Minor cleanup
- Replace corrupted `oslsr_master_v3.xlsx` fixture (tied to 4.1). Decide on keeping the two xlsx backups (git history is the real backup; keep `.pre-email.bak` until the rebuild is done).
- Redundant `oslsr_master_v3.pre-email.bak.xlsx` committed in the 9-58 commit — keep for now (it's the rebuild base).

## 5. DATA REALITY (the "better grasp" that drives the redesigns)

- **Registry = 139 respondents**, NOT a single clean number. Breakdown (prod 2026-06-15): **76 completed** (have questionnaire `raw_data`) + **55 data_lost** (pre-2026-05-20 hemorrhage; `metadata.questionnaire_data_lost`; row exists, answers gone) + **7 no-submission** + **1 pending-NIN**.
- **Questionnaire answers live in `submissions.raw_data` (JSONB)**, ~45 keys, with **drift across form versions** (`dob`↔`date_of_birth`, `firstname`↔`first_name`↔`surname`, gps variants).
- **The analytics + registry-summary count the 76** (`submissions WHERE raw_data IS NOT NULL`) but **label it "Total Respondents"** — silently excluding the 63 incomplete/lost and double-counting multi-submission respondents. This is the core analytics-redesign problem (§6).
- **Cohort recovery (re-engagement):** deduped master = **306** (Cohort A data_lost 55 = 46 email-reachable + 9 phone-only; Cohort B stalled drafts 268 = 217 Step-4 + 51 early; 16 A↔B email overlaps deduped). Files in §7.

## 6. DESIGN INITIATIVES TO FORMALIZE (need SM Bob + PM John)

### Track A — Analytics redesign (Registry / Export / Survey Analytics)
- System is **already rich** (Survey Analytics: 10 tabs, stat tests — chi-square/correlations/Kruskal-Wallis/Wilson CIs/Gini/forecast — LGA choropleth, **42 chart components**). The gap is **NOT more charts.**
- **Core problem = counting/honesty:** "Total Respondents" = submission count (76) not respondents (139); variable per-chart denominators with N never shown; **data-completeness invisible** (no 139→76 funnel, no `data_status`, no field response-rates, no data-lost recovery view).
- **Proposed (foundation → features):** (1) a shared **`registryTotals`** model (distinct respondents + `data_status` split) consumed by all pages; label honesty + N per chart; a new **Data Health** view. (2) Registry table: add `data_status` + `reference_code` columns + filter. (3) Export page: pre-download preview/data-health + wire in 9-59. (4) a few real analysis gaps (gender earnings gap, LGA equity comparison, field missingness). **Feed 9-59's key-normalization into analytics too** (one map, both surfaces).

### Track B — Design-system refresh (Shadcn enforcement)
- **Verified:** Shadcn IS set up (16 `components/ui` primitives + `components.json` + `cn()`), mostly used (33/44 pages import ui, 30/44 use Card) — **but never *enforced***: **13/44 pages carry inline `style={{}}`, 7 hand-roll raw `<table>`, there is NO shared `Table`/`DataTable` primitive, and NO lint rule** prevents drift. The **Audit Trail page** (`features/audit-log/`) uses Shadcn primitives but **hand-rolls its table** — the proof case.
- **Proposed (foundation → migrate → features):** (1) add the missing **`DataTable` primitive** (Shadcn `table.tsx` + TanStack-Table recipe — the keystone; fixes Audit + Registry + 5 others) + **lint enforcement** (ban inline styles via `react/forbid-dom-props`; `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss`). (2) migrate the 13 inline-style + 7 raw-table pages. (3) do Track A on this consolidated foundation.
- **Tracks A + B are ONE epic** ("Dashboard System Refresh") — sequence **foundation-first** (DataTable + lint gate), then migrate, then analytics. Don't add analytics onto the drift.

## 7. PROD-DATA ARTIFACTS (operator Desktop — PII; delete after use)
`respondents-full-export.csv` (139), `cohort-a-data-lost.csv` (55), `cohort-a-email.csv` (46), `cohort-a-phone.csv` (9), `cohort-b-stalled-step4.csv` (217), `cohort-b-stalled-early.csv` (51), `cohort-master-send-plan.csv` (306 deduped). `stranded-data-lost.csv` (9) is a subset of cohort-a — deletable.

## 8. NEXT ACTIONS (ordered)
1. **Finish the form fix (4.1)** — rebuild clean xlsx + N3 label → verify → replace repo fixture + commit → operator re-pin to prod.
2. **Convene SM (Bob) + PM (John)** to: align epics/PRD/architecture/UX-spec/project-context with everything in §3/§5/§6; author the **Dashboard System Refresh epic** (Tracks A+B) + confirm 9-59 sequencing; ensure nothing here is lost.
3. **Operator follow-ups (4.2)** on their own cadence; **9-18 AC#E9** on 2026-06-18.
