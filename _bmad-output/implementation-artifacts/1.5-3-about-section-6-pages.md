## Dev Notes

### CRITICAL: Route Structure Analysis

Current App.tsx About routes (lines 102-143):
```tsx
<Route path="about">
  <Route index element={<PlaceholderPage title="About The Initiative" />} />
  <Route path="how-it-works" element={<PlaceholderPage title="How It Works" />} />
  <Route path="leadership" element={<PlaceholderPage title="Leadership" />} />
  <Route path="partners" element={<PlaceholderPage title="Partners" />} />
  <Route path="privacy" element={<PlaceholderPage title="Privacy Policy" />} />
</Route>
```

**ISSUE 1**: Missing `/about/initiative` route - the IA document expects:
- `/about` → Landing page (overview)
- `/about/initiative` → The Initiative (detailed)

Current structure has `/about` index showing "About The Initiative" which should be the landing page.

**ACTION REQUIRED**: Add `/about/initiative` route and update `/about` index to be the landing page.

### CRITICAL: NavDropdown.tsx MUST Be Updated

**Location:** `apps/web/src/layouts/components/NavDropdown.tsx` (lines 16-21)

Current `aboutItems` array is **WRONG**:
```tsx
const aboutItems = [
  { href: '/about', label: 'The Initiative', ... },  // ← WRONG! Should be landing page
  { href: '/about/how-it-works', ... },
  // ...
];
```

**Required Fix:**
```tsx
const aboutItems = [
  { href: '/about', label: 'About OSLSR', description: 'Overview of the initiative' },
  { href: '/about/initiative', label: 'The Initiative', description: 'Why we are building this registry' },
  { href: '/about/how-it-works', label: 'How It Works', description: 'Understand the registration process' },
  { href: '/about/leadership', label: 'Leadership', description: 'Meet the ministry leadership team' },
  { href: '/about/partners', label: 'Partners', description: 'Our collaborating organizations' },
  { href: '/about/privacy', label: 'Privacy', description: 'How we protect your data' },
];
```

**WHY THIS MATTERS:** MobileNav.tsx imports `aboutItems` from NavDropdown, so if you only fix App.tsx but not NavDropdown, the header/mobile navigation will link to wrong pages!

### Existing Patterns to Reuse

1. **SectionWrapper** from `features/home/components/`:
   ```tsx
   import { SectionWrapper } from '../home/components/SectionWrapper';
   // Variants: 'default' | 'light' | 'dark' | 'primary'
   ```

2. **SectionHeading** from `features/home/components/`:
   ```tsx
   import { SectionHeading } from '../home/components/SectionHeading';
   ```

3. **FeatureCard** from `features/home/components/`:
   ```tsx
   import { FeatureCard } from '../home/components/FeatureCard';
   // Good for AboutNavCard base
   ```

4. **StepIndicator** from `features/home/components/`:
   - Reuse for How It Works step display

5. **Container pattern**:
   ```tsx
   <div className="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
   ```

### Image Assets Already Available

```
/images/oyo-state-logo.svg - Oyo State Government logo
/images/oyo-coat-of-arms.svg - Oyo State Seal
```

Use these for Leadership Oversight section and Trust sections.

### Lazy Loading Pattern

```tsx
// In App.tsx
const AboutLandingPage = lazy(() => import('./features/about/pages/AboutLandingPage'));
const InitiativePage = lazy(() => import('./features/about/pages/InitiativePage'));
// ... etc

// Barrel export in features/about/index.ts
export { default as AboutLandingPage } from './pages/AboutLandingPage';
// or
export * from './pages/AboutLandingPage';
```

### Content Copy Source

ALL content copy comes from `docs/public-website-ia.md` Section 3 (lines 369-910).

Key wireframe sections:
- 3.1: About Landing (lines 371-444)
- 3.2: Initiative (lines 448-518)
- 3.3: How It Works (lines 522-624)
- 3.4: Leadership (lines 628-688)
- 3.5: Partners (lines 692-743)
- 3.6: Privacy (lines 747-894)

### Icon Suggestions (Lucide React)

```tsx
import {
  BarChart3,           // Policy Planning
  GraduationCap,       // Skills Training
  Briefcase,           // Job Creation
  Building2,           // Investment Attraction
  TrendingUp,          // Program Evaluation
  Smartphone,          // Create Account
  Mail,                // Verify Email
  ClipboardList,       // Complete Survey
  BadgeCheck,          // Get Verified
  ShieldCheck,         // Data Protection
  Lock,                // Encryption
  Key,                 // Access Control
  FileText,            // Audit Logging
  Shield,              // Security Testing
  User,                // Profile placeholder
  Building,            // Government
  Users,               // Partners
  Info,                // Callout
  CheckCircle2,        // Checkmark items
  XCircle,             // "What We Don't Do"
} from 'lucide-react';
```

### NIMC Link for NIN Registration

For the "How It Works" page NIN callout, use these official links:
```
NIMC Official Site: https://nimc.gov.ng/
NIN Enrollment Centers: https://nimc.gov.ng/enrollment-centers/
```

Link text: "Don't have a NIN? Here's how to get one →"

### Placeholder Content Strategy

For Leadership and Partners pages where real content isn't available:
- Use placeholder text "[Name]" for names
- Use generic avatar icons for photos
- Add data attributes for easy content replacement: `data-placeholder="commissioner-name"`
- Comment in code where Ministry content goes

### Test File Pattern

```tsx
// apps/web/src/features/about/__tests__/AboutLandingPage.test.tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import AboutLandingPage from '../pages/AboutLandingPage';

describe('AboutLandingPage', () => {
  it('renders hero section with correct heading', () => {
    render(
      <BrowserRouter>
        <AboutLandingPage />
      </BrowserRouter>
    );
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })).toHaveTextContent(
      "Understanding Oyo State's Workforce"
    );
  });

  it('displays all navigation cards', () => {
    render(
      <BrowserRouter>
        <AboutLandingPage />
      </BrowserRouter>
    );
    expect(screen.getByText('The Initiative')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('How It Works')).toBeInTheDocument();
    // ... etc
  });
});
```
