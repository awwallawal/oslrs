✦ Based on my investigation of the apps/api directory, here are my findings regarding the drizzle-kit issues:

  🔍 Findings

   1. Critical Configuration Anti-Pattern:
      Your apps/api/drizzle.config.ts is configured to read the schema from the compiled JavaScript output:
   1     schema: './dist/db/schema/index.js',
      Why this is breaking: drizzle-kit is looking at the dist folder. If you added code for the "last two stories" (e.g., users.ts,       
  audit.ts) but didn't successfully run pnpm build or tsc after every single change, drizzle-kit sees an outdated or missing schema. This  
  causes migrations to be skipped, missed, or desynchronized.

   2. Fragile Workflow:
      Because of point #1, your workflow currently requires Code Change -> Build (TSC) -> Drizzle Command. If the build fails (which is    
  common during active development), you cannot run database migrations, creating a deadlock.

   3. Missing Convenience Scripts:
      apps/api/package.json lacks dedicated database scripts (e.g., db:generate, db:migrate, db:studio). This forces manual command
  execution, which is error-prone and doesn't enforce the correct environment variables or context.

  💡 Recommendation (The Fix)

  I propose to:

   1. Repoint Drizzle to Source: Change drizzle.config.ts to read directly from ./src/db/schema/index.ts. This allows drizzle-kit (which
      supports TypeScript via tsx or native parsing) to see your live code changes instantly without needing a build step.
   2. Add Scripts: Inject standard db:* scripts into apps/api/package.json to standardize how migrations are run.

  Shall I proceed with these fixes?
